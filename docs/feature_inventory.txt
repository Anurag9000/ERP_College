# Comprehensive Feature Inventory

Legend:  
- [DONE] fully implemented in the current code base  
- [PARTIAL] implemented in part, but gaps remain as noted  
- [TODO] not yet implemented

Sources reviewed: `src/main/java/main/java/**` (gui panels/dialogs, services, utils, DAO layer), Flyway SQL migrations under `src/main/resources/db/**`, and delivered docs under `docs/`.

## Baseline Specification
### Delivered
- [DONE] Role-based login that launches role-specific dashboards (`src/main/java/main/java/gui/LoginFrame.java`, `gui/MainFrame.java`).
- [DONE] Catalog/section tables with search & filters for both students and staff (`gui/panels/StudentSelfServicePanel.java`, `SectionPanel.java`, `EnrollmentPanel.java`).
- [DONE] Student registration & drop workflow with prerequisite, credit-cap, and maintenance checks via `StudentSelfServicePanel`, `EnrollmentService.java`, and `DatabaseUtil.java`.
- [DONE] Instructor grade entry, assessment weight editing, stats, and maintenance awareness in `gui/panels/InstructorWorkspacePanel.java` + `service/GradebookService.java`.
- [DONE] Transcript export to CSV/PDF from `StudentSelfServicePanel#exportTranscript*`.
- [DONE] Admin CRUD for users/students/faculty/courses/sections (`UserManagementPanel.java`, `StudentPanel.java`, `FacultyPanel.java`, `CoursePanel.java`, `SectionPanel.java`) plus staff-driven enrollment oversight (`EnrollmentPanel.java`).
- [DONE] Admin UI to assign instructors to sections (`gui/dialogs/SectionDialog.java`) and toggle maintenance in-app (`MaintenancePanel.java` + `AdminService.toggleMaintenance`).
- [DONE] Student drop/enroll deadlines enforced (`EnrollmentService.java` validates section deadlines before write).
- [DONE] Waitlist management with automatic promotion and notifications (`DatabaseUtil#registerStudentToSection` / `#dropStudentFromSection`).
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Maintenance mode enforcement: StudentSelfServicePanel, EnrollmentService, InstructorWorkspacePanel, and InstructorAttendancePanel block writes, but admin CRUD panels still bypass the guard.
- [PARTIAL] Timetable day/time grid + rich printable layout: students can export table listings to ICS/PDF, but there is no calendar-grid visualization or admin publish flow.
- [TODO] Instructor grade CSV import/export hooks.
- [TODO] Optional backup/restore automation beyond the manual steps documented in `docs/database/README.md`.

## Platform & Architecture
### Delivered
- [DONE] Dual datasources (auth + ERP) wired through HikariCP with Flyway migrations (`config/DataSourceRegistry.java`, `data/DatabaseBootstrap.java`, `src/main/resources/db/**`).
- [DONE] DAO coverage for auth users plus every ERP table (students, faculty, courses, sections, enrollments, attendance, waitlists, notifications, settings, finance) in `src/main/java/main/java/data/dao/`.
- [DONE] Central configuration loader + application settings (`config/ConfigLoader.java`, `src/main/resources/application.properties`) for JDBC, security, and session timeout.
- [DONE] Finance reminder scheduler delivering hourly installment reminders/digests (`utils/FinanceReminderScheduler.java`).
- [DONE] Legacy `.dat` migrator to seed SQL schemas (`data/migration/LegacyDataMigrator.java`).
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Dual-database documentation: `docs/database/README.md` covers provisioning + rollback, but ERDs and full seed-loader docs are still missing.
- [TODO] Package modularisation + dependency injection (UI/services still talk to `DatabaseUtil` directly).
- [TODO] Health checks/config diagnostics (no datasource ping or startup sanity reporting).

## Authentication & Security
### Delivered
- [DONE] Self-service change password dialog embedded in every role (`gui/dialogs/ChangePasswordDialog.java`, invoked from `MainFrame` and `StudentSelfServicePanel`).
- [DONE] Admin password reset that forces "must change next login" (`UserManagementPanel.resetPassword`, `DatabaseUtil.resetPasswordByAdmin`).
- [DONE] Password policy enforcement + PBKDF2 hashing, history checks, and lockout tracking (`utils/PasswordPolicy.java`, `utils/PasswordUtil.java`, `DatabaseUtil` auth helpers).
- [DONE] Audit logging for logins, lockouts, password events, enrollments, grade edits, finance payments, maintenance toggles (`utils/AuditLogService.java`, DAO + SLF4J) with an exportable UI (`gui/panels/AuditLogPanel.java`).
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Session inactivity timeout: `MainFrame` tracks idle time and auto-logs out, but the countdown label is never initialised so users do not see the banner warning requested in the spec.

## Data Migration & Repositories
### Delivered
- [DONE] DAO-backed persistence for enrollment, grade, attendance, waitlist, and settings data (`EnrollmentDao`, `AttendanceDao`, `WaitlistDao`, `SettingsDao`).
- [DONE] Finance + notification repositories (`PaymentTransactionDao`, `FeeInstallmentDao`, `NotificationDao`) integrated with the UI.
- [DONE] Legacy `.dat` import path via `LegacyDataMigrator` to populate both schemas on first boot.
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Migration tooling/docs for `.dat` files: code exists, but there is no operator playbook beyond a note in `docs/database/README.md`.
- [TODO] Datasource health probes and richer DAO error surfacing (errors still bubble up as generic IllegalStateExceptions).

## Student Experience
### Delivered
- [DONE] Catalog browsing with search, day filter, open-only toggle, maintenance banner, and contextual advisories (StudentSelfServicePanel.java).
- [DONE] Registration/drop actions delegated to `EnrollmentService` with prerequisite, deadline, and credit-load enforcement plus waitlist promotion + notifications (`DatabaseUtil` + `EnrollmentService`).
- [DONE] Timetable tab with ICS + PDF export (`StudentSelfServicePanel#exportScheduleIcs/#exportSchedulePdf`).
- [DONE] Grades tab summarising assessments, final marks, and risk alerts via `updateGradeAnalytics`.
- [DONE] Transcript CSV/PDF exports with custom formatting (`exportTranscript`, `exportTranscriptPdf`).
- [DONE] Finance tab showing fee summary, payment history, installment plan, and a reminder button tied to `DatabaseUtil.markInstallmentReminderSent`.
- [DONE] Notification inbox enhancements: category filter, unread toggle, mark read/unread, refresh, backed by `NotificationDao`.
- [DONE] Self-service change password launch button and maintenance warning banner.
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Registration workflow enhancements: time clash detection works, but there is no room-clash check, advisor approval queue, or co-/anti-requisite enforcement (CourseRelationshipDao is unused); deadlines are enforced.
- [PARTIAL] Timetable day/time grid + rich printable layout: students can export table listings to ICS/PDF, but there is no calendar-grid visualization or admin publish flow.
- [PARTIAL] GPA/standing analytics: textual summaries and trend hints exist, but no historical charts or probation alerts.
- [TODO] Transcript watermarking, certificate downloads, and registrar messaging workflow.

## Instructor Workspace
### Delivered
- [DONE] Instructor workspace for roster selection, assessment definition, grade entry, final grade computation, stats, and maintenance-aware enablement (InstructorWorkspacePanel.java + GradebookService.java).
- [DONE] Instructor attendance capture per assigned section (`InstructorAttendancePanel.java`) with maintenance guard.
### Outstanding
- [TODO] Attendance CSV import/export, bulk updates, tardiness tracking, and analytics dashboards (UI is manual only).
- [PARTIAL] Gradebook enhancements: assessment definitions exist, but there are no templates, CSV import/export, moderation workflow, publish/finalise toggles, or inline rubric feedback.
- [TODO] Instructor analytics widgets (grade distributions, pass/fail counts, attendance charts).
- [TODO] Messaging hub for instructors to reach sections.
- [TODO] Section planner for clash/capacity warnings.

## Admin Console & Operations
### Delivered

- [DONE] EnrollmentPanel for staff-driven registration/drop, schedule visibility, waitlist counts.
- [DONE] AttendancePanel for marking attendance and viewing history across sections.
- [DONE] FeesPanel with searchable roster, payment recording, installment editor dialog, and CSV exports (summary + per-student statements).
- [DONE] NotificationsPanel for broadcasting ALL/STUDENT/INSTRUCTOR/ADMIN messages.
- [DONE] MaintenancePanel for toggling maintenance and invoking callbacks.
- [DONE] AuditLogPanel for viewing/exporting audit events.
### Outstanding
- [PARTIAL] Full user lifecycle UI: no suspend/reactivate toggles or per-user audit history.
- [PARTIAL] Catalog management depth: no dedicated UI for prerequisites, room inventory, or capacity planning beyond manual fields.
- [PARTIAL] Enrollment oversight (approvals, overrides, extensions) beyond manual register/drop in EnrollmentPanel.
- [PARTIAL] Maintenance scheduler: only immediate toggles exist; no future windows or countdown banners.
- [TODO] Data governance (backup/restore wrappers, archival, anonymisation scripts).
- [PARTIAL] Reporting suite: dashboard metrics exist, but there are no drill-down reports for waitlists, attendance compliance, or financial arrears.
- [TODO] Bulk CSV/XLS import/export for master data (current exports are limited to finance/audit tables).
